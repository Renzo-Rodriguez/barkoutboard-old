            <!--Add content to the story here-->
            <p>MESA Crime Scene Science is a very fun and creative project where you build, solve problems, and have fun. It's fun because of all the building and solving mysteries. You have to build a dna and plant model and solve murder mysteries to win. It's easy to win as long as you know biology. The competition goes by fast and its fun because you will only have 15 minutes to solve the crimes. Crime Scene Science is a very good choice if you're new to MESA or if you like projects where you're not too stressed. The 1st place winners for the recent competetion were Grace Saji, Anita Pallipaden, and Abel Antony, who were new to MESA.</p>
