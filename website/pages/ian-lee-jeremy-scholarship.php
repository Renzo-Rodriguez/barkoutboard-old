            <!--Add content to the story here-->
            <p>Jeremy has scored an Amazon Engineer scholarship of $10,000 per year + internship every summer. He
                totally deserves it. He is always helpful, polite, responsible and very diligent. Best of all, I once
                talked to his mom about how she did a great job raising such a fine child, his mom said, "I don't have
                to do anything. They (Jeremey and his twin brother Joel) just want to study hard, and get a good job so
                we can live in a better house..."</p>

            <strong>
                <p>Example: As a publisher for The Saintly Bark Out Board, John Doe is responsible for overseeing and
                    managing
                    the content that is posted on the site. In his free time, John Doe enjoys exploring new hiking
                    trails in the
                    nearby mountains, practicing his photography skills, and playing guitar. He finds that these hobbies
                    help him
                    unwind and stay inspired when it comes to creating content for the Bark Out Board.</p>
