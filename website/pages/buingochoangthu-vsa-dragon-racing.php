            <!--Add content to the story here-->
            <p>The Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) is known for their impressive dragon dance performances during
                the Tet holiday season. The dragon dance is an essential part of Tet celebrations and is believed to
                bring good luck and fortune for the new year. VSA members spend months preparing for their dragon dance
                performances, carefully choreographing their movements and designing their costumes. The dance involves
                a team of performers manipulating a long, colorful dragon figure that twists and turns in sync with the
                music. The fast-paced drumming, colorful costumes, and the intricate movements of the dragon make for a
                truly unforgettable experience. Through their dragon dance performances, VSA members help to keep this
                important cultural tradition alive and promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of Vietnamese
                culture among the wider community.</p>
