<p id="text">Hi all,
        Last week my daughter (Phylisha Pham, will be a freshman next year at ST) and two of our current ST students (Kaylee Osorio (junior) and Alison Lam (sophomore)) representing Team USA went to Colombia to compete in the Pan American Games for Acrobatics Gymnastics 2022. Unfortunately, Alison sustained an ankle á»‹njury while training in Colombia but with the help of the USA medical staff, they were miraculously brought back a GOLD medal in their Balance routine and BRONZE in their dynamic routine. They also hit their goal for earning 27+ in all three final routines.  
        
        I am so proud of them, please congrat Kaylee and Alison if you have them in your class when they come back to school next week.  
        FYI, the two students are still on STIS today. We didn't get home until 12:30 AM today.
        
        Best,
        
        Pauline
         
        Attached is the video of their combined routine if you are curious.
