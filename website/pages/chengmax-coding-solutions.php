            <p>In Santa Teresa, there is a club called MESA (Math, Engineering, Science, and Academics) which participates in an annual event known as MESA Day. During this event, MESA competes with other clubs from different schools. One of the exciting events in MESA Day is Coding Solutions, where students from Santa Teresa MESA and other MESA clubs demonstrate their coding skills and compete to see who can code faster. Before attending the event, students from all MESA clubs typically undergo training by taking a coding course called CodeHS. After completing the course, students participate in a competition known as Mini MESA Day, hosted by their respective home clubs, to demonstrate their qualifications for MESA Day.
<br><br>
In 2023, Santa Teresa managed to achieve an impressive <strong>2nd place</strong> in Coding Solutions! The students who won this achievement are Krish Kumar and Giwin Edwin Omesh.</p>
