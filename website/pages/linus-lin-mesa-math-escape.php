            <p>As a personal member of Math Escape Room, I can say it is one of the very popular projects in the STHS MESA club. Gaining its popularity from the many awards won by amazing participants including James Kim, Danwoo Yoo, and Jason Muench. You work with your partners to solve real-world problems and see which team can "escape" the quickest. It is fun, intense, and available for any age group in highschool. Math Escape Room is the perfect project for anyone as long as you enjoy mathmatics and exciting challenges.</p>
