<p id="text">Hello Saints,

        It's Coach Papin.  I wanted to inform everyone that our Saints Football Team will be playing in the CCS Championship game this Saturday at 1:00 at San Jose City College.  I know It's a Holiday weekend but the team would really appreciate your support.  Also since we are off from school for 3 days can you help spread the word in your classes these next 2 days.  First time our football team has played for a CCS Championship since 1987.  Come out and support us as we try to make history by winning our first CCS Championship in school history.   "GO SAINTS"</p>
