            <p>Although smaller than most bands in Northern California, STHS Marching Band and Color Guard has proved time and time again that it is formidable in competition and consistently presents quality of music and in show production no matter how big the band is, and how many members it has. In the past two years (2021-2022) the STHS Maching Band and Color Guard has won competitions all across the season, crowned WBA 2A (Western Band Association) champions in 2021, and 4th out of 12 schools in Northern California for class 3A in 2022. Our Color Guard has consistently won first place in almost all competetions during the 2022 season, and our entire Marching Band won first place in the Sacremento Super State Marching Band Competition. Through grueling practice hours of 4 hours, for three days a week, and 8 hours every Saturday, our members have improved durastically enough that we were able to produce such quality results in only 3 months of time!   </p>
