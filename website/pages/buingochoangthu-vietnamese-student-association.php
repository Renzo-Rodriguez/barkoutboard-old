            <p>
                The Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) is well-known for their annual Tet activities, which are a celebration of the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. VSA members organize a variety of events and activities to commemorate this important holiday and share Vietnamese culture with the community.
                <br><br>
                One of the main activities organized by VSA during Tet is the Tet Festival, which is typically held on or around the Lunar New Year. The festival is a vibrant and colorful celebration that features traditional Vietnamese music, dance, and cuisine. VSA members work tirelessly to prepare for the festival, creating decorations, designing costumes, and perfecting their performances.
                <br><br>
                In addition to the Tet Festival, VSA also organizes other events and activities throughout the holiday season. These may include cultural shows, workshops on traditional Vietnamese crafts and cooking, and community service projects. The aim of these activities is to not only celebrate Vietnamese culture but also to promote community engagement and give back to those in need.
                <br><br>
                Another important aspect of VSA's Tet activities is their focus on family and community. VSA members often invite their families and friends to participate in the holiday celebrations, creating a sense of togetherness and unity. They also reach out to the broader community, hosting events that are open to everyone and encouraging participation from people of all backgrounds.
                <br><br>
                Overall, VSA's Tet activities are a highlight of the Lunar New Year celebrations in many communities. They are a testament to the importance of preserving and sharing Vietnamese culture, as well as promoting community engagement and unity. Through their efforts, VSA members help to keep traditional customs alive and promote understanding and appreciation among diverse groups of people.
