            <p>Early in the morning, 20 students and 2 teachers boarded a Southwest flight. Their destination? The
                Pacific Model United Nations conference, shortend to PACMUN. Here, Delegates toured and gained knowledge
                about the Hawaiian Island's, and over the weekend of November 18th, 2022 to November 20th, 2022,
                participated
                in debate regarding hypothetical solutions to not only the future of our nation, but global problems
                such as Global
                Warming, Space Exploration, The Equality of Women, Economic Stability, and many more. In addition, half
                of STMUN's
                delegates participated in a 'Joint Crisis Committee'(Otherwise known as a JCC), a type of committee
                which ties the
                action of one 'Sub Committee' to all four sections of the JCC. Our Santa Teresa Delegates participated
                in all four
                sections of the JCC, whose topic was "The Russo-Ukrainian War". However, not just JCC delegates, but all
                delegates
                demonstrated fabulose composure, not falling to critizism on their potential solutions, while also
                commenting and
                collaborating with those who viewed the subject matter differently.

                During their visit to Honolulu, the STMUN delegation had the opportunity to explore two of the city's
                most popular
                attractions, Diamond Head and the Honolulu Zoo. The hike up Diamond Head provided the delegates with
                breathtaking
                views of the city and the surrounding natural beauty. The group was fascinated to learn about the
                volcanic history of
                the area and the significance of Diamond Head to the local culture. At the Honolulu Zoo, the delegates
                had a private
                tour of the facility and enjoyed seeing the diverse collection of animals, including rare and exotic
                species. They also
                learned about the zoo's conservation efforts and how the facility works to protect endangered species.
                The visit to the
                zoo was an immersive and educational experience that left a lasting impression on the group.

                The Pacific Model United Nations Conference, or PACMUN, is a prestigious annual conference that brings
                together high school
                students from across the Pacific Northwest and beyond to simulate the United Nations. The conference
                offers an unparalleled
                opportunity for young leaders to develop their public speaking, negotiation, and critical thinking
                skills, as well as to learn
                about international relations, diplomacy, and global issues. Through lively debates and intense
                negotiations, delegates tackle
                complex challenges related to peace and security, human rights, economic development, environmental
                sustainability, and more. The
                PACMUN conference is known for its professionalism, high standards, and rigorous preparation, and
                attracts participants who
                are passionate about making a positive impact in their communities and the world.
                <br><br>
                The PACMUN conference was an exciting and rewarding experience for the delegates who participated. The
                conference offered a unique
                platform for high school students to engage in rigorous debates and discussions on some of the most
                pressing global issues. The
                delegates demonstrated impressive negotiation skills, critical thinking, and public speaking abilities
                as they worked collaboratively
                to draft resolutions and reach consensus on complex problems. The conference was well-organized, and the
                delegates were given ample
                opportunities to learn from experienced diplomats and speakers. The keynote speakers offered valuable
                insights into international
                relations and the workings of the United Nations, which was invaluable to the delegates' understanding
                of global issues. Additionally,
                the various committees and councils offered a diverse range of topics, providing delegates with the
                chance to delve into specific issues
                that they were passionate about. Throughout the conference, the delegates were immersed in a
                professional and supportive environment, which
                allowed them to learn and grow both personally and professionally. The PACMUN conference was an
                enriching experience that challenged the
                delegates to think critically, communicate effectively, and work collaboratively to create innovative
                solutions to global challenges.
                Overall, the PACMUN conference proved to be an inspiring and educational experience for all who
                participated.
