<p id="text">Dear Colleagues, 
        Although it has been a couple of weeks since our team returned, My Nguyen and I wanted to give you an update about our RIMUN conference that we attended in March.
        
        RIMUN was the perfect capstone to a vigorous MUN year.  Our students stayed with Roman students as the second part of the foreign exchange that we started when the Romans attended our conference in January.  We visited the Vatican, the Pantheon, the Forum, the Colosseum, and countless piazzi and fountains.  We ate our weight in pasta, pizza, and gelato--for many of our team, it was the opportunity to taste foods they've never been exposed to.  We heard the Mayor of Rome and several Italian diplomats speak to us about climate change, civic responsibility, and advocacy.  And the students participated in five days of competitive MUN debate with students from around the world.  It was a great trip.
        
        Please also congratulate Aarushi Arya and Kim Le for winning a Verbal Commendation for their committee leadership.
