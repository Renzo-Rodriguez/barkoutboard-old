            <p>The Social Innovation Challenge is a team project that uses the Design for Delight methods to learn more about problems that everyday people have. After learning more about people's problems, group members collaborate together to find an effective solution to solve a social challenge while still keeping an eye out for possible problems within the solution. After coming up with a solution, teams make a video demonstrating their solution, their process of getting the solution, and lastly showing what they learned from the Design for Delight method. The main skills learned in this challenge were critical thinking, brainstorming, collaboration, customer empathy, and video presentation. 1st place for this challenge gets a $5,000 scholarship, 2nd gets $3,000 scholarship, and 3rd gets a $2.000 scholarship. Then regional winners get Airpod pros. In our school, Marcus Dinh, Teiji Futamase, Jeet Lad, and Linus Lin got 2nd place. Kyle Kim, Long Le, Gabe Manglona, Christian Miyoko got 3rd place. Then, Katherine Bui, Fatima Naqvi, Jenny Pham, Emma Raphael, Sudiksha Sahoo, Veda Valavala, Syncere Smith, Tevin Tran, and Michael Trang were regional winners.</p>
