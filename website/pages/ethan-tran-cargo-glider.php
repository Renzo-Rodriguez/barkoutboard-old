            <h1><strong>MESA's Cargo Glider</strong></h1>
            <p>MESA stands for Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement. It is a national program in the United States that aims to support underrepresented students in pursuing degrees and careers in math, engineering, and science fields. The program provides academic support, mentoring, and hands-on learning opportunities to students in grades 6th-12th and college. The MESA program was established in California in 1970 as a way to increase the number of students from underrepresented backgrounds who pursue degrees and careers in math, engineering, and science fields. The program has since expanded to several other states and has served hundreds of thousands of students over the years. MESA offers a range of services and activities, including academic support such as tutoring and study groups, college and career readiness programs, hands-on engineering and science projects, and competitions and events. The program also provides mentoring and networking opportunities to help students connect with professionals in their fields of interest.

                Santa Teresa's MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) club's Cargo Glider project is designed to compete in the MESA National Engineering Design Competition. The competition challenges teams of students to design and build a glider capable of carrying a payload of 4 ping pong balls and gliding the longest distance possible.
                In the various projects undertaken by the Santa Teresa MESA club, students are typically expected to form teams of 3-4 people and collaborate to build a machine, solve challenging problems, or create and deliver speeches.  There are many projects in MESA, such as Civil structures, Moon base, MESA Machine, Math Escape Room, Think tank, NEDC, Speak Easy, Crime Scene Science, Coding solutions, Cargo glider, and more!
          <br><br>
                In Santa Teresa's MESA's Cargo Glider, the Cargo Glider is designed to be lightweight, with a wingspan of around 6 feet and a length of about 3 feet. The glider is made primarily of balsa wood, with additional components such as duck tape and wood glue. The cargo in the Cargo Glider is commonly located in the center of the glider, and must carry a payload of 4 ping pong balls. In designing and building the glider, the teams conducted extensive testing and analysis to optimize its performance. They conducted multiple trials to identify weaknesses and flaws, which they then repaired and corrected.
                <br><br>
                During the competition, the Cargo Glider is launched from a ramp using a large slingshot and must fly as far as possible while carrying its payload. Teams are judged based on the distance the glider travels, as well as the accuracy of their design and construction documentation. The Cargo Glider is an impressive example of student engineering and design, and demonstrates the potential of hands-on learning opportunities to inspire and develop the next generation of scientists and engineers.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the Cargo Glider project was a great example of the kind of hands-on engineering and design work that MESA encourages and supports. It gave students the opportunity to apply their math, science, aerodynamic skills, and engineering skills in a real-world project and compete with their peers at a national level.  The project also helped to develop important skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking.
