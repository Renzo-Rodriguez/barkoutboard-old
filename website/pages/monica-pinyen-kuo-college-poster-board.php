The project first caught our Mesa Members' attention with the simple requirement and exciting topic. The project took time from the End of September to Mid October. In the first week, they collected information and researched the college the members wanted to present to judges. They finally made the poster boards during the second to third week. All poster boards were exceptionally creative and well-made, with cardstock, backgrounds, and colorful borders. When Mesa was ready, they finally went to Roberto Cruz Leadership Academy on the 18th of October to compete. Our Mesa was well prepared and focused on giving a natural presentation; they had all their knowledge about their presented college! Everyoneâ€™s hard work was expressed through their presentation and posters. <br> Congratulations again, and exemplary job, everyone! </p>
